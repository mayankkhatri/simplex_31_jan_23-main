                  Express Entry Program -
                </strong>{" "}
                Launched in 2015, Express Entry is an online application management
                system that governs all federal streams under economic migration
                programs, which includes Federal Skilled Worker, Canadian Experience
                Class, and Federal Skilled Trades. Under this system, people who wish
                to live and work in Canada, and who meet the minimum eligibility
                requirements may submit an expression of interest in applying for
                permanent residence by creating an online profile.
              </p>
              <p>
                Every profile under the Express Entry is given a Comprehensive Ranking
                System (CRS) score that is further used to rank applicants against
                each other in the pool. The higher the scores, the better are the
                chances for receiving an Invitation to Apply from Immigration,
                Refugees, and Citizenship Canada (IRCC).

                  Canada Provincial Nominee Programs -{" "}
                </strong>
                The Canadian government has given its provinces rights in selecting
                economic immigrants and inviting them to permanently settle in Canada.
                Every province in Canada has its own levels of guidelines and
                selection criteria to pick candidates to address labor shortage needs
                of that particular province. All these provincial immigration streams
                are popularly known as Provincial Nominee Programs (PNPs).

                </strong>
                As compared to any other Canadian province, Quebec enjoys a high
                degree of authority to set its own rules for immigration. Presently,
                no Quebec immigration stream is aligned with Express Entry. However,
                candidates may choose to apply directly for the Quebec Skilled Worker
                Program, the Quebec Experience Class, and Quebec Business Immigration.

                <strong>Student Pathway- </strong>Student pathway is a definitive
                choice for any one who is not eligible for any of the immigration
                streams mentioned above. Interested candidates may choose to study in
                Canada as the credentials they gain while studying here can instantly
                improve their chances for obtaining Canada PR visa. Since many
                immigration programs give preference to Canadian student experience,
                studying in Canada can be an ideal way to get a Canadian permanent
                resident status.

                <strong>Start-up Visa-</strong>This visa category is suitable for high
                net-worth entrepreneurs who want to set up a new business in Canada.
                For this, they must get their business or business idea sponsored by
                an authorized body in Canada and thus migrate to the country
                permanently.

              <p>
                <strong>Family Sponsorship-</strong> Family reunification is the
                second most popular way of migrating to Canada permanently. If you are
                married to person or have a child who is a Canadian citizen, they can
                sponsor you to come to Canada. The only condition is that the sponsor
                must be financially strong enough to support you in Canada.
