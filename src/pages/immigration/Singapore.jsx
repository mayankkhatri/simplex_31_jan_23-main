            <h1>SINGAPORE IMMIGRATION AND VISA CONSULTANCY SERVICES FOR INDIANS</h1>
            <p>Singapore has a fairly large number of MNCs (Multinational companies.) This, in turn, has fuelled the growth of this island-nation which is also one of the four Asian tigers. This city-state has a very stable economy and provides various opportunities for research and specialized jobs. Further, from a job perspective, acquiring work experience from one of the fast-paced startups or MNCs of Singapore can aggrandize your resume.</p>
            <p>Singapore’s government has set up the tax system to maximize business investment. The tax levied on businesses is quite low. Further, the income tax is a lot lower than that of most other developed nations. Singapore also has a booming IT sector.</p>
            <p>Of course, there is much more to life than work. A multicultural ambiance makes it easier for new immigrants to integrate into the society. Still, the majority of people have their ethnic backgrounds as Indians, Chinese or Malays. There is no paucity of entertainment options in Singapore. Adventure parks, shopping malls, and luxurious hotels are more than enough to kindle a spark in your life.</p>
            <p>English is the official language of Singapore. Hence, you won’t have to learn a new language to live, work or study in this country.</p>
            {/* <h2>APPLICATION PROCESS</h2>
        <p>Acquiring a travel visa is fairly easy. You must have a return ticket from Singapore in order to get your travel visa.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, work visa or employment pass can be difficult to acquire. Firstly, you must acquire a job in a Singapore based institution. Then, you should apply for a work permit or employment pass in Singapore. The application process can be lengthy and demanding.</p>
        <p>Apart from this, you can also apply for a business visa. For acquiring a business/ investor/entrepreneur visa, you must show evidence of sufficient funds that you’ll be investing in Singapore based institutions</p> */}
            <p>Various dependent visa categories and family nomination visas are also available. The applicant will require documents proving the relationship with the dependents.</p>
